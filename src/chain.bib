abstract="We consider service requests that arrive in an online fashion in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) with network function virtualization (NFV). Each request is a flow with a high-level specification of routing and processing (by network functions) requirements. Each network function can be performed by a specified subset of servers in the system. The algorithm needs to decide whether to reject the request, or accept it and with a specific routing and processing assignment, under given capacity constraints (solving the path computation and function placement problems). Each served request is assumed to ``pay'' a pre-specified benefit and the goal is to maximize the total benefit accrued. In this paper we first formalize the problem, and propose a new service model that allows us to cope with requests with unknown duration without preemption. The new service model augments the traditional accept/reject schemes with a new possible response of ``stand by.'' We also present a new expressive model to describe requests abstractly using a ``plan'' represented by a directed graph. Our algorithmic result is an online algorithm for path computation and function placement that guarantees, in each time step, throughput of at least a logarithmic fraction of a (very permissive) upper bound on the maximal possible benefit.",

This waypoint routing problem finds immediate applications in the context of modern networked distributed systems. Our main contribution is an exact polynomial-time algorithm for graphs of bounded treewidth. We also show that if the number of waypoints is logarithmically bounded, exact polynomial-time algorithms exist even for general graphs. Our two algorithms provide an almost complete characterization of what can be solved exactly in polynomial-time: we show that more general problems (e.g., on grid graphs of maximum degree 3, with slightly more waypoints) are computationally intractable.",

abstract = "The rise of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) introduce opportunities for service providers to reduce CAPEX/OPEX and to offer and quickly deploy novel network services. In particular, SDN and NFV enable the flexible composition of network functions, a generic service concept known as network service chaining (NSC). However, the control of resources, management and configuration of network service chains is challenging. In particular, there typically exist multiple options on how an abstract network service can be decomposed into more refined, inter-connected network functions. Moreover, efficient algorithms have to be devised to allocate the network functions. The underlying algorithmic problem can be seen as a novel generalization of the Virtual Network Embedding Problem (VNEP), where there exist multiple realization options. The joint optimization of decomposition and embedding has not been studied in the literature before. This paper studies the problem of how to optimally decompose and embed network services. In particular, we propose two novel algorithms to map NSCs to the network infrastructure while allowing possible decompositions of network functions. The first algorithm is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) which minimizes the cost of the mapping based on the NSCs requirements and infrastructure capabilities. The second one is a heuristic algorithm to solve the scalability issue of the ILP formulation. It targets to minimize the mapping cost by making a reasonable selection of the network function decompositions. The experimental results indicate that considering network function decompositions at the time of the embedding significantly improves the embedding performance in terms of acceptance ratio while decreasing the mapping cost in the long run in both optimal and heuristic solutions."
