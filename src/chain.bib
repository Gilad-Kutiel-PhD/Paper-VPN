abstract="We consider service requests that arrive in an online fashion in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) with network function virtualization (NFV). Each request is a flow with a high-level specification of routing and processing (by network functions) requirements. Each network function can be performed by a specified subset of servers in the system. The algorithm needs to decide whether to reject the request, or accept it and with a specific routing and processing assignment, under given capacity constraints (solving the path computation and function placement problems). Each served request is assumed to ``pay'' a pre-specified benefit and the goal is to maximize the total benefit accrued. In this paper we first formalize the problem, and propose a new service model that allows us to cope with requests with unknown duration without preemption. The new service model augments the traditional accept/reject schemes with a new possible response of ``stand by.'' We also present a new expressive model to describe requests abstractly using a ``plan'' represented by a directed graph. Our algorithmic result is an online algorithm for path computation and function placement that guarantees, in each time step, throughput of at least a logarithmic fraction of a (very permissive) upper bound on the maximal possible benefit.",

abstract="We initiate the study of a fundamental combinatorial problem: Given a capacitated graph {\$}{\$}G=(V,E){\$}{\$}G=(V,E), find a shortest walk (``route'') from a source {\$}{\$}s{\backslash}in V{\$}{\$}s∈Vto a destination {\$}{\$}t{\backslash}in V{\$}{\$}t∈Vthat includes all vertices specified by a set {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathscr {\{}W{\}}{\backslash}subseteq V{\$}{\$}W⊆V: the waypoints. This waypoint routing problem finds immediate applications in the context of modern networked distributed systems. Our main contribution is an exact polynomial-time algorithm for graphs of bounded treewidth. We also show that if the number of waypoints is logarithmically bounded, exact polynomial-time algorithms exist even for general graphs. Our two algorithms provide an almost complete characterization of what can be solved exactly in polynomial-time: we show that more general problems (e.g., on grid graphs of maximum degree 3, with slightly more waypoints) are computationally intractable.",
