In this section we present an FPTAS algorithm to the VPN problem.
We are given an instance of the VPN problem 
\begin{align}
D_v = (V_v, A_v)			\\
D_p = (V_p, A_p)			\\
(s_v, t_v, s_p, t_p)	\\
(p_d, b_d, p_c, b_c)	\\
c
\end{align}
For now assume all values are integral and polynomial bounded in the size of the input.
Sort the DAGs topologically and assume w.l.o.g that $s_v = s_p = 1$,
$t_v = n$, and $t_p = m$.
Let $O(i, j)$ be the optimal embedding of any $1i$ virtual path, 
into a $1j$ physical path.
We can compute $O(i, j)$ as follow:
$$
O(i, j) = \min_{a \text{ ancestor of } i} \min_{b \text{ ancestor of } j} O(a, b)
+ \min_(ai, bj)
$$
Where $\min(ai, bj)$ is the optimal embedding of a virtual 
path starting at any child of $a$, $a'$ and ending at $i$ into node $j$
that respect the bottleneck constraint, i.e. $b_d(a, a') \leg bn(b, j)$.
\todo{define bn(i, j) to be the bottleneck between i and j}
We claim that $\min(ai, bj)$ can be found efficiently
